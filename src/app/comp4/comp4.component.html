    Angular forms 
</h4>
<p>
    Angular provides two different approaches to handling user input through forms: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Reactive forms provide direct, explicit access 
        to the underlying forms object model. 
        Compared to template-driven forms, they are more robust: 
        they're more scalable, reusable, and testable. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Template-driven forms rely on directives in the template to create 
        and manipulate the underlying object model. They are useful 
        for adding a simple form to an app, such as an email list 
        signup form. They're easy to add to an app, 
        but they don't scale as well as reactive forms.

</ul>
