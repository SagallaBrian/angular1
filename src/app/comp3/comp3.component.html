    Services and dependency injections 
</h4>
<p>
    Service is a broad category encompassing any value, function, or 
    feature that an app needs. A service is typically a class 
    with a narrow, well-defined purpose.
</p>
<p>
    Dependencies are services or objects that a class needs to perform 
    its function. Dependency injection, or DI, is a design pattern in 
    which a class requests dependencies from external sources rather than creating them.
